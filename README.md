# ZOOMIEE #
Greetings to the Readers !
I have created website to deliver a platform to the user in which one can easily communicate and interact with larger groups all around. Specifically its a replica similar to zoom
and other similar applications. <br/>
Where individulas can talk on video call, share content, hold meetings, classes or can simply chat. <br/>
Using these basic features can bring about tremendous beneficial aspects: <br/>
* HEALTH SECTOR <br/> 
* EDUCATIONAL SECTOR (especially for students) <br/>
* PROFESSIONAL SECTOR
<br/>

How to use this app 
---------------
Anyone who wishes to conduct a free meeting (with or without video) has to just click on this link : <br/>
<div align="center">
<pre>
<a href="https://thawing-headland-23372.herokuapp.com/">https://thawing-headland-23372.herokuapp.com/</a>
</pre>
</div>
A unique room id will be genrated each time when you open the above link, later share the link with the person with whom you want to start the meeting and he will be in the same meeting room. <br/>
You have to give permission to your camera and microphone when using this app for the first time.
